Meteor project 5 and 6

This is the code that I have so far for the employee directory.  I looked at the HelloMeteor and reviewed all the files
that you had.  I still cannot figure out the Meteor Method in the server file to remove the employees.  It was so much 
easier in the collections.  I know that I still need to make it look nicer and I need to add the onclick events and the fields. 
I will continue to work on this each night.  I leveraged the css files that you used and read a little information about
them.  I am still lost on some things but will look at the videos for 5 and 6.
